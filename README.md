# BOOKHUB
This ia an application for displaying the books collection of a particular online book application. This application gives a brief jist of the book.
The application also allows to add that book into your favourites so that you can find it whenever you want in the favourites section.
I have attached several screenshots so as to give the user a glimpse of application interface.
This is a practice application made for practice on JSON file inputs using kotlin, XML and SQL.
